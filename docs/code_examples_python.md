Examples for calling the Forecasting and Backcasting endpoints and visualising the results have been prepared in jupyter notebooks, using python3.
	
	
* [Forecasting Example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alvin-chan/bdt_django_front_end_postgres_mkdocs/blob/master/code_examples/forecast_example_1.ipynb?flush_cache=true) 

	Restaurant forecasting the next 7 days, for an item with shelf-life of 2 days, with daily deliveries
	
* [Backcasting Example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alvin-chan/bdt_django_front_end_postgres_mkdocs/blob/master/code_examples/backcast_example_1.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
	
	Backcast Simulation over 30 days, for a business forecasting 2 days ahead each time, for an item with shelf-life of 2 days, with daily deliveries.
	
	Approx $6,000/month of cost savings and profit improvement vs business-as-usual (wasting 20% of all delivered units)
